### Data Science Work

I did analyze the data set given to us by sahibinden.com authorities. The analysis is in the jupyter notebook. 

The notebook requires the data set named 'all_data 3.json' in same directory with ipynb file to load the data.

The analysis consists of some parts:  
1 - Data Cleaning   
2 - Feature Extraction    
3 - Preprocessing    
4 - Derivations with Machine Learning    
5 - Some more analysis on data

Overall, I was understanding the data, derive meanings and importances of features using machine learning.

I also tried to build a predictor based on this data, however, I could not have time to tune the model.
