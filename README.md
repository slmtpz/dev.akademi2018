### Data Science

I did analyze the data set given to us by sahibinden.com authorities. The analysis is in the jupyter notebook.  

The analysis consists of some parts:  
1 - Data Cleaning
2 - Feature Extraction
3 - Preprocessing
4 - Derivations with Machine Learning

Overall, I was understanding the data, derive meanings and importances of features using machine learning.

I also tried to build a predictor based on this data, however, I could not have time to tune the model.
